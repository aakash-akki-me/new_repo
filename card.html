    <p>This Vietnamese-style noodle salad is my 'too hot to cook' staple. It is bursting with flavor and makes great use
        of leftover grilled meat or shrimp.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dressing:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup water, or more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Salad:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package (linguine-width) rice noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups thinly sliced Napa (Chinese) cabbage</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups matchstick-cut carrots</li>
        <li>8 ounces grilled shrimp</li>
        <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
        <li>½ English cucumber, halved lengthwise and cut into thin slices</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup coarsely chopped peanuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar
        is dissolved.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute.
        Stir to separate the noodles and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more. Drain
        noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil
        together in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped peanuts.</p>
    <h2>Dealer's Choice:</h2>
    <pre>Dressing can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 5 days.

    You can use sambal oelek chile pepper sauce or red pepper flakes in place of Sriracha, if that better fits your tastes.
        
    Any leftover grilled meat works well in this salad: shrimp, pork, or chicken are all great options.
        
    The salad is very flexible; try adding julienned red or yellow pepper, pea pods, baby bok choy, or substitute sliced romaine lettuce for the cabbage.
